#### What's in here?

The `play-sangria-starter` is just that, a simple play26-based backend starter kit. It comes with some preloaded set up, like configuring a simple controller as well as setting up the basic configuration for two different NoSQL databases (Neo4j and MongoDB). You can use one, both or neither of these (just delete what you won't use).

- [**Play 2.6**](https://www.playframework.com/) - A scala web framework
- [**GraphQL**](http://graphql.org/) - A query language for APIs
- [**Sangria**](http://sangria-graphql.org/) - A scala implementation of GraphQL
- [**Neo4j**](https://neo4j.com/) - A popular graph database using the Cypher language spec
- [**neo4j-java-driver**](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver) - A Java-based driver for interacting with neo4j
- [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A NoSQL database
- [**ReactiveMongo**](http://reactivemongo.org/) - A Scala-based Mongo driver

#### Contributing

If you have some additional components you would like to see in here, I would be more than happy to accept PRs. Depending on the size and specificity of your PR I may or may not merge it. I expect this repo to be kind of a swiss army knife, but I will draw the line somewhere.
